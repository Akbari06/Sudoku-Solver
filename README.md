# Sudoku Solver
• Program where you input a 9x9 grid and the output is where the empty cells are filled in accordance with the
sudoku rules.

• Implemented a backtracking algorithm having help from GitHub, the algorithm attempts to place a number in an
empty cell, recursively tries to solve the puzzle and then backtracks if a contradiction is found and developed a
constraint checking to ensure that before placing a number the program checks if its valid in the current position.

• Taught me more about Python programming and a deeper understanding of why backtracking algorithm is used.
